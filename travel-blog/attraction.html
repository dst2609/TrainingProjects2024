        <h2>Sabarmanti Ashram</h2>
        <img src="attraction-1.jpeg" alt="Description of Attraction 1" />
        <p>
          Architected in 1915, Sabarmanti Ashram was one of the many residences
          of Mahatma Gandhi. The Bhagavad Gita was recited here daily as part of
          the Ashram schedule. It was from here that Gandhi led the Dandi March.
          This Ashram is a national monument. Today, the Ashram is a museum
          dedicated to the life and principles of Gandhi.
        </p>
        <p>
          The ashram has a museum, Gandhi Smarak Sangrahalaya, which preserves
          Gandhi's work and memory. The museum includes an archive, library, and
          exhibition on Gandhi's life.

        <h2>Adalaj Step-well</h2>
        <img src="attraction-2.jpeg" alt="Description of Attraction 2" />
        <p>
          The Adalaj Stepwell, also known as the Rudabai Stepwell or vav in
          Gujarati, is a five-story stepwell in Gujarat, India. Built in 1498 by
          Queen Rudadevi in memory of her husband, Rana Veer Singh, the stepwell
          is an example of Solanki architecture and is intricately carved from
          sandstone.
        </p>
        <p>
          The stepwell has three entrances that lead to a platform with an
          octagonal top that rests on 16 pillars. The corners of the platform
          have shrines carved into them, and the five floors are spacious enough
          for people to gather. The carvings on the stepwell depict a variety of
          subjects, including women churning butter and adorning themselves in
          front of a mirror. The fifth floor offers a view of the well's deep
          turquoise waters, which some say seem to glow with inner light.

        <img src="attraction-3.jpeg" alt="Description of Attraction 3" />
        <p>
          Gujarat Science City is a science education and entertainment center
          in Ahmedabad. The center is an initiative by the Gujarat government to
          encourage students to pursue science education. It opened in 2002 and
          expanded in 2021
        </p>
        <p>
          The center also has exhibits on science, space, plants, nature, and
          robotics. It features interactive galleries, working models, virtual
          reality, activity corners, labs, and live demonstrations. Some say the
          aquatic area and robotic area are informative and elegant, while
          others say the hall of science needs an upgrade
